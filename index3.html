<head/>Hobbies of Timothy Jones</br>
<body/><br> 
<p/>Starting off right from the bat, I do not really have any hobbies anymore like when I was younger.  Adulting is not that fun, paying bills, buying groceries, car payments, insurance, oh wait, you just got married and now have two children.  It's going to be all cupcakes, butterflies and rainbows.  Sorry.  It is not.  When I first found out my wife was pregnant, I asked a friend of mine, who all ready had several children the best way to prepare.  He looked at me in a very serious manner and told me "Sit down and seriously think about everything you ever wanted to do with your life and write it all down, do not forget a single thing.  Then get into your car drive 80 mph around the loop with that list, crumple it up and throw it out the window because none of it is going to happen now.  Your life as you know it is over, it is all about your family you have now created."  To some that may sound harsh, but once you have children your life is changed exponetially.<br>
<p>I have found new things that I like though that I am able to do with my two little girls around.  I really enjoy spending time with them now that they are older, no offense but babies are not my thing.  My girls are 5 and 7 years of age and are my world now.  They have helped me grow up as I help them grow up and the best part is my children have no idea how much they have changed me and helped me grow along with them.  So even as their father my new hobbies are playing horsy, having tea time and have them cook me their "food" from their toy kitchen.  Of course we go outside, when possible, and play tag and play board games inside, because it does tend to get cold here.
<p>It is very rare that I get any time to myself to just kick back and relax but when I do, that time is normally dedicated to school work.  I want to be able to show my children that no matter what struggles you may face in life and what little time you may have, nothing is impossible.  Yes, you may get behind, yes, you might fail a test or a homework assignment because life happens, but you get yourself right back up and continue fighting.  There is nothing in this world that can keep you down, but yourself.  I keep fighting and will not stop until I feel satisfied with the work I have completed and the history I have laid behind me for those to follow to be an inspiration not only to my children but for all people to follow.<br>
<p>So, I am assuming your wondering what my hobbies are since I did not just lay them out in plain text.  My hobbies are to be the best example I can be for my children, inspire others, be a great father, a great husband, always make time for my family and to never ever give up on education so that one day we can all benefit humanity and come together as one, because knowledge is power.<br>
