<p/>At this moment I am majoring in a Masters Degree of Data Science.  Data scientists usually have a Ph.D. or Masterâ€™s Degree in statistics, computer science or engineering. This gives them a strong foundation to connect with the technical points that form the core of the practice in the field of data science.<br>
<p/>Data Scientists are involved in Programming, Machine Learning techniques, Data Visualization and Reporting, Risk Analysis, Statistical analysis and Math, Effective Communication, Software Engineering Skills, Data Mining, Cleaning and Munging, Research
and working with Big Data Platforms.  It is a very diverse degree that opens many doors for anyone pursuing this degree.<br>
<p>This semester I am taking this CSCI 110, CSCI 242, Math 208.  It is a lot to take on at once, but once you are able to hit your stride with them all and keep in conctact and stay on top of everything it makes it much easier to link all the courses together and how they all work together.  It is challenging at first, but once you are able to not sleep, dream of coding, calculus, trigonomentry, and AVL's it makes it all the easier.  Also, in my thinking it is the final piece of the puzzle to make what I am working towards become a reality.<br> 
<p/>  What I would like to do with the combination of my degrees is to be able to make things possible that once were thought impossible.  Things people only see in movies, or things that people are not able to fully comprehend to true nature and extent that it takes to bring certain things to reality.  I am here to prove that not only is it possible, it is going to be our reality one day.  Through the use of knowledge of the human body and the use of computers, I want to help veterans first that come home from war, then make it all accessible to everyone at the lowest price if not for free.<br>
