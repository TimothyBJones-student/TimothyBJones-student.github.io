<p/>At this moment my favorite class is CSCI 110.  I take a great interest in computers and computers are going to become used more and more in the future.  This class makes learning to use computers easier, with the games, taking it nice and slow so that those of us that are new to programming can catch on.  Computers are doing more and more all ready in our daily lives and are even performing surgeries from across the globe.  Just the other day I was reading about how a pt had a surgery done here in the USA from a surgeon in England using robotic arms.<br><p/>

<p/>I also enjoy the method that Dr. Stokke uses to teach the course.  I know that at times he does begin to ramble off on a tangent, but he does get back on topic and we all get refocused as a class.  I know that several of the students in here may not be taking this course for their Major, it is just a requirement.  Although it is always good to know about computers and at least be able to get your way around them effectively.<p>  <br>
